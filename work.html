                <p class="rain-city-tattoo-info-text">In this project, I used the MEVN stack. I wanted a way for the tattoo shop to be able to handle enquiries and also send out last-minute emails to users when they had cancelations, so I added this functionality and built a custom backend that allows the shop to take enquiries and also allows users to sign up to a specific artist's cancellation list. When users either make an enquiry or sign up to the cancellation list, they receive a confirmation email. When the shop wants to let their respective cancellation lists know they have a cancellation, I have built the option for them to write a custom message to all the users on their list that will automatically be sent by email to all users on that artist's list.</p>

                <p class="simple-blog-info-text">In this project, I used the MEN stack. In this simple blog site, I gave users the ability to view all the posts on the site, but if a user wants to make a post then they have to make an account and sign in. Once signed in you can create a blog post, you can edit the post with the summernote (WYSIWYG) editor and you can upload a picture for your post. This project uses bootstrap along with EJS (Embedded JavaScript templating) on the front end and MongoDB, Express and Node on the backend</p>
